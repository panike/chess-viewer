Here is how to use the system.

First you have a pgn file, say games.pgn

Then you ``compile'' it:

compiler -f games.pgn -o games.db

This command produces by default, ``dbfile'' and ``games_index.db''

Then you might want to produce a html file to point to the server

tagshtml -f dbfile -http 'http://localhost:3025'

Finally you run the server

server -images 'http://www.math.wisc.edu/~panike/chess' -p 3025 -log logfile \
	-idx games_index.db
