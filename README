Here is how to use the system.

First you create the images and place them where the web server can find them.

First you have a pgn file, say games.pgn

Then you ``compile'' it:

compiler -f games.pgn -o games.db

This command produces by default, ``dbfile'' and ``game_index.db''

You should sort these:

LC_ALL=C sort dbfile > temp; mv temp dbfile
LC_ALL=C sort game_index.db > temp; mv temp game_index.db

Then you might want to produce a html file to point to the server

tagshtml -f dbfile -http 'http://localhost:3025'

The files that are the output of this should be placed where your web server
can find them.

Finally you run the server

server -images 'http://www.math.wisc.edu/~panike/chess' -p 3025 -log logfile \
	-idx game_index.db
